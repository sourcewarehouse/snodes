	<p>Core classes of the Spaghetti Nodes program. These are the classes that essentially make the program as a whole function. Without them, Spaghetti Nodes would just be a conglomeration of independent packages and classes with little to no cohesiveness. The classes in <tt>snodes</tt> are essentially the glue that binds Spaghetti Nodes together.</p>
	<p>One of the primary ingredients of the package is the set of classes that act as "controllers" that allow the other modules of the program to talk to each other easily and seamlessly.</p>
	<p>Classes in this package also provide services and functionality that is useful to other classes in the program as a whole.</p>
