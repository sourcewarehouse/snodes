	<p>Manages the connections between peers, as well as the processing of Snodes protocol packets. The package essentially allows other components in the program to deal with connections in a high-level, object-oriented manner.</p>
	<p>The key classe in the package is {@link snodes.net.SnodesConnection}, which models the connections between nodes. A use of this package's API might look like the following:</p>
	<pre>
// Create a connection to 192.168.0.2
SnodesConnection conn = new SnodesConnection("192.168.0.2");
// Authenticate the connection
conn.authenticate("mypasskey");
// Connect
conn.connect();
// Close connection
conn.disconnect();
	</pre>
